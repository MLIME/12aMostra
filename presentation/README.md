[These slides](https://github.com/MLIME/12aMostra/blob/master/presentation/src/pdf/PrimeirosPassosDL.pdf) were created for the "12ª aMostra", an event organized by the undergrad students in statistics at the University of São Paulo. We ([Antonio](https://github.com/Abello966) and [Felipe](https://github.com/felipessalvatore)) try to
