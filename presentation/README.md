[These slides](https://mlime.github.io/files/PrimeirosPassosDL.pdf) were created for the "12ª aMostra", an event organized by the undergrad students in statistics at the University of São Paulo. We ([Antonio](https://github.com/Abello966) and [Felipe](https://github.com/felipessalvatore)) try to
explain some basic topics of deep learning such as: **computational graphs, deep feedforward networks, back-propagation and convolutional neural networks**. The slides are in Portuguese.
